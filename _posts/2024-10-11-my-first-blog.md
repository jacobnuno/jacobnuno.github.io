I've been wanting to start a blog for some time, but I either never had the chance or didn't make the time for it. I also had no idea how to do it, but I always knew one thing: my blog should be simple to create, maintain, and write (and, of course, free).

Today, I’m going to explain why I chose the technologies I did. If you're interested in creating your own, check out my [other blog post]({% post_url 2024-10-10-create-your-first-blog %}) where I explain how to do it step-by-step.

This blog is powered by **Markdown**, **Jekyll**, and **GitHub**. That's all you need to know to get started.

### First, why Markdown?
It's a simple syntax, easy to learn, and offers many options for writing rich text. Plus, it's well-supported across platforms.

### Second, what does Jekyll have to do with my blog?
Well, Jekyll handles all the coding and behind-the-scenes work to make the blog function. It compiles my blog posts into HTML and serves them. It lets you define layouts and offers plugins for things like pagination, handling files, routing, styles, etc. It's like a mini framework that helps you develop your blog with minimal effort.

Why did I choose it? Because there are great templates available. The one I picked required me to only define my blog’s name and description, and that was it. The only thing left to do was to start writing—which is what I wanted all along! Jekyll also integrates smoothly with GitHub.

### Now, why GitHub?
You probably know GitHub, and if not, it’s because you’re not a developer—and that’s totally fine. GitHub allows developers (like me) to save and manage code for our projects, and it's free (at least as of today!). 

Beyond storing code, GitHub also offers free hosting (another checkmark for being free). Every time I create a new blog post and push the code to my branch, **GitHub automatically detects the changes and redeploys my blog**. There’s no need to manually trigger updates—everything happens seamlessly with each push.

### The bottom line
Thanks to the Jekyll template (Minima) and GitHub, the only thing I have to focus on is writing. Everything else is automated and easy to manage.
